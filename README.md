# Installation
To run the application, make sure you have Node.js installed.
Clone this repository to your drive and execute this command in the root:
`npm install`
This will install the neccessary packages.

After that, to compile the JavaScript code, issue the following command:
`npm run build`
This will build all JavaScript, CSS and image assets.

If you now open `index.html` you should see the application operational.
